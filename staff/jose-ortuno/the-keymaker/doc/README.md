## The Keymaker
The Keymaker is a web-app for creating and managing real estate property appointments with potential buyers via invitation. With our app, agents can invite interested customers and arrange visits to specific deployments. Once a customer accepts the proposed schedule, The Keymaker validates the appointment, locks the time slot and sends the customer an invitation and a virtual key via email. Once this process is confirmed, the potential buyer can visit the deployment and enter the property by themselves (no agent required) with the supplied Keymaker virtual key.

## Motivation
The web-app generates a history of keys based on user, invitation, deployment, date of appointment and expiration date.

Users can generate new virtual keys and change their statuses, which are ‘standby’, ‘cancelled’, ‘visited’ and ‘expired’. They are also able to save their user-generated history of deployments, on which they can modify specific deployment information and switch their status from ‘active’ to ‘inactive’.

The web-app allows for more than one user.

The virtual key (token) can show the following statuses:

- Valid token
- Cancelled token
- Used token
